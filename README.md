## Goal
Recently got caught up on golang, read through some documentation, decided to give it a try to build a simple login page
with golang as the server

## Plan (I guess this is kinda like a sprint plan)

1, UI of the page

## Choice of different libraries and why

- styled-components
  I am a big fan of simplicity in life and specially in coding( Well, I try to be).
  The way styled components structured is completely rhythming with React or React Native. 
  I embrace the culture of inline styling especially this library makes everything even easier to use.
  
- formik
  Just go check their documentation
  The three issues they pointed out is exactly why I need it the whole time.

## Lastly
  This is only a repo for myself to improve my skills. Do not judge but welcome any chatting.
